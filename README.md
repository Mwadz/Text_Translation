## Context
Neural networks have a lot of depth and require a lot more tinkering.

**Objectives:**
* Spend a week practicing the newly introduced tensor flow library.
* Give myself more time to create a thorough neural network
* Give myself an opportunity to practice working together
* Give myself an opportunity to present a long term project ahead of the project period.
